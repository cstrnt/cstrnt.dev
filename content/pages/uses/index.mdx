### Editor & Terminal

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my editor for literally anything. I never used something else because my Apprentice
  said it's the best and I love it as well!

- I use the [Horizon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode) for VS Code
  preferably in the _Italic_ variant.

* I use [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) as my font and I dont't regret spending ~50â‚¬ for that even though some colleagues called me
  crazy for buying a font.

* My terminal of choice is [Hyper](https://hyper.is). I just love it because it's cross-platform and has themes.

* I use oh-my-zsh with many plugins (because I never remove them if they work).

### Apps

- I use [Figma](https://figma.com) to design and prototype stuff

- All of my code is on [Github](https://github.com) because I got Pro for free for being a student and it's just awesome!

- For static deployments I use [Netlify](https://netflify.com) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for anything else..

### Desk Setup

- My Monitor is a 34" [BenQ EX3501R](https://www.amazon.de/BenQ-EX3501R-Curved-Gaming-Monitor/dp/B075JGKX59)

- My Laptop is a late 2017 Macbook Pro with 8 gb memory
