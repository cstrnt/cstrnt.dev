Hi!

My name is Tim and I'm a 22 year-old developer from Cologne, Germany.

Coding is my job and also my passion which is the thing I always dreamed about!

My personal favorites include JavaScript and it's ecosystem. Especially React, Svelte and Node.js to name a few. I recently became quite addicted to TypeScript which I thought I would never say (You were right Marcel & Philipp).

I'm currently working at a small company in cologne and it's great.

In my free time I love coding for some side projects but somehow it's hard to find time for that.

My girlfriend and I have four cute guinea pigs which are really cute and entertaining.

Thanks for reading

Tim.
