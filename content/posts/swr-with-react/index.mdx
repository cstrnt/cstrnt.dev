We will now now have a look at [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) by Vercel (formerly zeit).
It calls itself _React Hooks for Remote Data Fetching_ which pretty much describes it's purpose.
SWR makes use of a concept called _stale-while-revalidate_ which allows the UI to feel more reactive as every time
you call your remote API the hook will return the cached values first while waiting for the response from the server.
As soon as it got the data from the server it will revalidate the cache and returns the freshest data to the UI. This comes in really handy
when you change pages (e.g. using react-router) as the data will be loaded from the cache first. This makes it possible to **not** show
loading spinners every time you change to a page you already visited. But let's get into examples:

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());

function Posts() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR("/posts", fetcher);

  if (error) return <p>failed to load</p>;
  if (!data) return <p>loading...</p>;

  return (
      /** render our page with our posts */
  );
}
```

Lets break this code into smaller chunks again:

```jsx
const { data, error } = useSWR("/posts", fetcher);
```

Right here we're
