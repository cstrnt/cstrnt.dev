We will now now have a look at [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) by Vercel (formerly zeit).
It calls itself _React Hooks for Remote Data Fetching_ which pretty much describes it's purpose.
SWR makes use of a concept called _stale-while-revalidate_ which allows the UI to feel more reactive as every time
you call your remote API the hook will return the cached values first while waiting for the response from the server.
As soon as it got the data from the server it will revalidate the cache and returns the freshest data to the UI. This comes in really handy
when you change pages (e.g. using react-router) as the data will be loaded from the cache first. This makes it possible to **not** show
loading spinners every time you change to a page you already visited. But let's get into examples:

### Basic Usage

```jsx
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());

function Posts() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR("/posts", fetcher);

  if (error) return <p>failed to load</p>;
  if (!data) return <p>loading...</p>;

  return (
      /** render our page with our posts */
  );
}
```

Lets break this code into smaller chunks again:

```jsx
const { data, error } = useSWR("/posts", fetcher);
```

Right here we're defining the unique _key_ for that particular query. In our case this is the endpoint of the API
we are calling. To use SWR properly you should always use the same key for the same request, because SWR uses the _key_ to cache the data. The second argument _fetcher_ is some kind of function which creates a HTTP-Request. In our case it is just `window.fetch`. But you can also use something such as [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). the `useSWR` hook then passes the key as the first argument to that fetcher function. Therefore I would recommend adding the base URL to the API your going to call to the fetch function like this:

```js
const fetcher = (endpoint, ...args) =>
  fetch(`https://my-api.com${endpoint}`, ...args).then((res) => res.json());
```

The next pieces are `{ data, error}` which are returned from the hook. Those ones are quite easy as they speak for themselves. `data` is the actual data returned from the server. It also can be `undefined` when the data is still loading. This happens only on the first load because there won't be any loading when getting the data from the cache. 
`error` will `undefined` if everything is going well, but if there was some kind of error during the fetch call this object will hold the error.

The next step is to give the user feedback what is happening right now. We do this by returning JSX Elements depending on the two variables we got from our hook. First of all we are going to check if there was an error. If so we display an error message or redirect the user. After that we check whether `data` has some values in it. If not, we know that our application is loading (because there is no error) and we can show the user a loading indicator (e.g. a spinner).

And that's it. Pretty clean, huh?
