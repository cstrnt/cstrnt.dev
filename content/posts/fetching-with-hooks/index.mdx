We are going to start with the most basic approach to data fetching in React, which will not require any additional dependencies what so ever. That being said this also is the approach with the least functionality and comfort!

This approach uses three main parts: The two hooks `useState` and `useEffect` and the browser-api `fetch` and can be seperated into three steps:

1. Provide some kind of loading state after mounting the component
2. Fetch the data from the remote server
3. Set the result of the fetch-request as the local state
4. Set Loading to false
5. Provide the data to the component

Speaking of JavaScript and JSX it would look like the following:

```jsx
function BlogPosts() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
      setLoading(true)
      fetch('SERVER-URL')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setPosts(data);
        setLoading(false)
      })
  }, []);

  return (
      ...
  )
}
```

Let's break this code down into smaller chunks:

```jsx
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
```

Right here we create local state variable which contains a loading boolean.
It is initialized with `false` because right at the beginning we technically aren't loading anything yet.
We use this to determine whether we are currently fetching the data or if we are already done.
We would probably use this boolean to show some kind of loading animation such as a spinner or a skeleton loader to the user.

```jsx
const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
```

I called the next state posts because I was talking about creating a blog earlier on but you should give this state a
semantic name which suites the actual data you are getting from your API. I initialized it with an empty array here because
I know the data will be some sort of list of posts (which in fact is an array). This gives me the opportunity to use
the handly autocompletion from vscode!

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  /** Code */
}, []);
```

We finally reached the actual data fetching part! Hooray! And this particular code snippet right here is the react api for
doing our request at the right time. Sounds weird, right? Because we want to set a local state variable after we
successfully got our data from the server we need to do it **after** the component mounted. Because we are only able to
access our `setPosts`-action when react was able to mount to component. This might sound quite weird for starters. Why can't
I use a function which I just declared two lines above? Well, that's just how react works after all. But the dev team was
so kind that they added another hook called `useEffect` which allows us to know when a component was mounted. We just need to
pass an empty array as the second argument to `useEffect` and it will assure that this code is executed after mounting the component.
Before hooks we did this in the `componentDidMount` function.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setLoading(true);
  fetch("SERVER-URL")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      setPosts(data);
      setLoading(false);
    });
}, []);
```

After we all know what useEffect does, let's have a look _inside_ it: First of all we are going to set our local state variable
`loading` to `true`. Now the user will know that the application is loading some kind of data.
While the user is distracted by our nice-looking loading-UI we will start fetching the data using `fetch`.

**Disclaimer: In this example I assume that you configured your fetch with the correct headers, auth and so on.
I also assume that the request won't fail at all**

When we got the data from the server we will update our local `posts`-state using our newly aquired data and after that
we are going to set `loading` to `false` so the user won't see the loading-UI anymore but instead sees all of the
awesome posts we got on our blog!
